# pptk - Point Processing Toolkit

Copyright (C) 2011-2018 HERE Europe B.V.

The Point Processing Toolkit (pptk) is a Python package for visualizing and processing 2-d/3-d point clouds.

At present, pptk consists of the following features.

* A 3-d point cloud viewer that
  - accepts any 3-column numpy array as input,
  - renders tens of millions of points interactively using an octree-based level of detail mechanism,
  - supports point selection for inspecting and annotating point data.
* A fully parallelized point k-d tree that supports k-nearest neighbor queries and r-near range queries
  (both build and queries have been parallelized).
* A normal estimation routine based on principal component analysis of point cloud neighborhoods.

Unless otherwise noted in `LICENSE` files for specific files or directories,
the [LICENSE](LICENSE) in the root applies to all content in this repository.



## Install

One can either install pptk directly from PyPI

```
>> pip install pptk
```

or from the .whl file that results from [building pptk from source](#build).

```
>> pip install <.whl file>
```

## Quickstart

In Python, generate 100 random 3-d points.

```
>> import numpy as np
>> x = np.random.rand(100, 3)
```

Visualize.

```
>> import pptk
>> v = pptk.viewer(x)
```

Set point size to 0.01.

```
>> v.set(point_size=0.01)
```

For more advanced examples, see [tutorials](https://heremaps.github.io/pptk/tutorial.html).

## Build

We provide CMake scripts for automating most of the build process, but ask the
user to manually prepare [dependencies](#requirements) and record their paths
in the following CMake cache variables.

* `Numpy_INCLUDE_DIR`
* `PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR`
* `PYTHON_LIBRARY`
* `Eigen_INCLUDE_DIR`
* `Qt5_DIR`

To set these variables, either use one of CMake's GUIs (ccmake or cmake-gui),
or provide an initial CMakeCache.txt in the target build folder
(for examples of initial cache files, see the CMakeCache.<platform>.txt files)



Example compilation command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fengwang/pptk.git
cd pptk && mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake .  -DEigen_INCLUDE_DIR:FILEPATH="/usr/include/eigen3" -DNumpy_INCLUDE_DIR="$(python -c 'import numpy; print("%s/numpy" % numpy.get_include())')" -DPPTK_PATCHELF:FILEPATH="/usr/bin/patchelf"
python setup.py bdist_wheel
```



##### Requirements

Listed are versions of libraries used to develop pptk, though earlier versions
of these libraries may also work.

* [QT](https://www.qt.io/) 5.4
* [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) 3.2.9
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) 2.7+ or 3.6+
* [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) 1.13

##### Windows

1. Create an empty build folder

```
>> mkdir <build_folder>
```

2. Create an initial CMakeCache.txt under <build_folder> and use it to provide
values for the CMake cache variables listed above. (e.g. see CMakeCache.win.txt)

3. Type the following...

```
>> cd <build_folder>
>> cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" <source_folder>
>> nmake
>> python setup.py bdist_wheel
>> pip install dist\<.whl file>
```

##### Linux

Similar to building on Windows.

##### Mac

Similar to building on Windows.


## TODOs:
1. clean all compilation warnings
2. replace tbb with thread
3. build pakcage for pip
4. CI/CD pipeline with github actions
5. ....
